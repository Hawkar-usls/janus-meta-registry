# data/INDEX — Evidence-first archive map

This is the current navigation index for the JANUS Meta Registry data layer.

The older **Visitor Doors** layout is preserved in Git history at audited commit [`364d3993…`](https://github.com/Hawkar-usls/janus-meta-registry/blob/364d3993dc318eb898fe5f2337a03d9214752ac1/data/INDEX.md). It is not deleted from history; this revision changes only the current navigation order.

## Read this first

## 1. Technical core — evidence, falsification, provenance

### Independent-future / causal evidence hardening

Primary objects, in recommended order:

1. [`proofs/JANUS-INDEPENDENT-FUTURE-NO-GO-AND-EVIDENCE-HARDENING-v0.5.json`](proofs/JANUS-INDEPENDENT-FUTURE-NO-GO-AND-EVIDENCE-HARDENING-v0.5.json) — exact-match/min-entropy no-go and sandbox self-certification boundary.
2. [`proofs/JANUS-SEQUENTIAL-ADAPTIVE-WITNESS-HARDENING-v0.6.json`](proofs/JANUS-SEQUENTIAL-ADAPTIVE-WITNESS-HARDENING-v0.6.json) — history-wise conditional bound, multiplicity penalty, and counterexamples to marginal/average entropy reasoning.
3. [`proofs/JANUS-ANYTIME-VALID-WITNESS-HARDENING-v0.7.json`](proofs/JANUS-ANYTIME-VALID-WITNESS-HARDENING-v0.7.json) — e-process/optional-stopping layer plus a falsifying marginal-null example.
4. [`proofs/JANUS-CAUSAL-ISOLATION-DSEPARATION-HARDENING-v0.8.json`](proofs/JANUS-CAUSAL-ISOLATION-DSEPARATION-HARDENING-v0.8.json) — common-cause, selection-collider, and parallel leak-path controls.
5. [`../registry/causal_topology/JANUS-TEMPORAL-CONTINUITY-ROLLBACK-REPLAY-GATE-v0.9.0.json`](../registry/causal_topology/JANUS-TEMPORAL-CONTINUITY-ROLLBACK-REPLAY-GATE-v0.9.0.json) — authenticity/freshness separation and rollback/replay boundary.
6. [`../registry/causal_topology/JANUS-MULTI-WITNESS-QUORUM-CONTINUITY-GATE-v1.0.0.json`](../registry/causal_topology/JANUS-MULTI-WITNESS-QUORUM-CONTINUITY-GATE-v1.0.0.json) — witness failure-domain/quorum model; majority is not assumed sufficient.
7. [`proofs/JANUS-PRECOGNITIVE-SEMANTIC-RETURN-GATE-REDTEAM-REPORT-v0.2.json`](proofs/JANUS-PRECOGNITIVE-SEMANTIC-RETURN-GATE-REDTEAM-REPORT-v0.2.json) — useful as anti-false-positive red-team; **not evidence of precognition**.
8. [`JANUS-PRECOGNITIVE-SEMANTIC-RETURN-GATE-v0.2.json`](JANUS-PRECOGNITIVE-SEMANTIC-RETURN-GATE-v0.2.json) — historical protocol name; physical retrocausality not established.

The underlying probability, causal-inference, martingale/e-process, and quorum ideas include substantial established prior art. The registry's potentially interesting contribution is their **explicit composition into fail-closed evidence protocols**, not ownership of the underlying mathematics.

### Proof-route / research-state audits

- [`JANUS-P-N-JUNCTION-PROOF-ROUTE-REPOSITORY-AUDIT-CAPSULE-v1.0/00-manifest.json`](JANUS-P-N-JUNCTION-PROOF-ROUTE-REPOSITORY-AUDIT-CAPSULE-v1.0/00-manifest.json)
- [`JANUS-FUNDAMENTUM-PROOF-CARRYING-LAB-STATE-v2.0.json`](JANUS-FUNDAMENTUM-PROOF-CARRYING-LAB-STATE-v2.0.json) — historical snapshot; current authority is [Janus-Fundamentum](https://github.com/Hawkar-usls/Janus-Fundamentum).

### Static archive forensics / software archaeology

- [`JANUS-TITAN-CORE-MODULE-AND-OPTIMIZER-LINEAGE-CAPSULE-v1.0/00-manifest.json`](JANUS-TITAN-CORE-MODULE-AND-OPTIMIZER-LINEAGE-CAPSULE-v1.0/00-manifest.json)
- Other normalized archive capsules preserve hashes, inventories, deduplication, static parsing, secret quarantine, and explicit non-execution boundaries.

### Cross-project methodological dossiers

See [`../registry/research_portfolio/`](../registry/research_portfolio/) and begin with:

- [`../registry/research_portfolio/JANUS-PROOF-CARRYING-EXPERIMENTAL-SCIENCE-INTERPRETATION-v1.0.0.json`](../registry/research_portfolio/JANUS-PROOF-CARRYING-EXPERIMENTAL-SCIENCE-INTERPRETATION-v1.0.0.json)
- [`../registry/research_portfolio/AIFC-AUDITABLE-INDEPENDENT-FUTURE-CHALLENGE-RESEARCH-DOSSIER-v1.0.0.json`](../registry/research_portfolio/AIFC-AUDITABLE-INDEPENDENT-FUTURE-CHALLENGE-RESEARCH-DOSSIER-v1.0.0.json)
- [`../registry/research_portfolio/CURRENT-PORTFOLIO-AUTHORITY.json`](../registry/research_portfolio/CURRENT-PORTFOLIO-AUTHORITY.json)

Global novelty remains external-review dependent.

---

## 2. Security / reliability research

- [`../security_research/revocation_canary/JANUS-STALE-EXECUTION-REVOCATION-POC-v1.0.json`](../security_research/revocation_canary/JANUS-STALE-EXECUTION-REVOCATION-POC-v1.0.json)
- [`../security_research/revocation_canary/JANUS-POST-CANCEL-ACK-PROOF-011-PREREG.json`](../security_research/revocation_canary/JANUS-POST-CANCEL-ACK-PROOF-011-PREREG.json)

**Audit status:** the strict result file `JANUS-POST-CANCEL-ACK-PROOF-011.json` is not present on the audited default branch. The strict post-cancel-ack side-effect claim is therefore **not established** here.

“Time traveler”, “LIMBO”, “storm”, and similar historical timing labels may coexist with useful scheduler observations, but they are not physical backward-causation claims.

For historical executable-code risks, use [`../docs/RUNTIME_SOURCE_TRIAGE_2026-08-09.md`](../docs/RUNTIME_SOURCE_TRIAGE_2026-08-09.md).

## 3. Useful conceptual design patterns

### Observation-chain / evidence-ledger design

- [`JANUS-BITCOIN-WHITEPAPER-INVERSION-LEDGER-SIGNAL-v1.0.json`](JANUS-BITCOIN-WHITEPAPER-INVERSION-LEDGER-SIGNAL-v1.0.json)

Useful idea: normalized observation windows + evidence hash + previous-evidence link + explicit claim gates.

`organism`, `self-awareness`, `machine self-truth`, `proof-of-breath`, and `diagnosis` are metaphorical project vocabulary unless separately established under conventional definitions and evidence.

### Research-planning / high-stakes domains

- [`JANUS-TRANCEPTION-CHRONIC-THREAT-NEURODEVELOPMENT-RESEARCH-CHEATSHEET-v1.0.json`](JANUS-TRANCEPTION-CHRONIC-THREAT-NEURODEVELOPMENT-RESEARCH-CHEATSHEET-v1.0.json)

This is a research-planning note, not clinical guidance. Current biological/medical claims intended for external use require fresh primary-source verification.

### Bio-derived materials / circular biomanufacturing

- [`SKYBU-SKINGPT-CIRCULAR-BIOMANUFACTURING-CONCEPT-v1.0.json`](SKYBU-SKINGPT-CIRCULAR-BIOMANUFACTURING-CONCEPT-v1.0.json) — early research concept linking SCOBY-derived bacterial nanocellulose, SkinGPT sensing skins, acetate co-product research, and a strictly separated food-grade fermentation lane. Ballistic armor, zero-waste, nutritional, and food-safety claims remain unestablished until independently validated.

---

## 4. Historical computational hypotheses

- [`JANUS-P-N-JUNCTION-COMPUTATIONAL-SEMICONDUCTOR-EXPERIMENT-v0.2.json`](JANUS-P-N-JUNCTION-COMPUTATIONAL-SEMICONDUCTOR-EXPERIMENT-v0.2.json) — small finite SAT heuristic experiments; no asymptotic conclusion.
- Historical P=NP/P≠NP language is preserved as provenance. **P vs NP remains OPEN.**

---

## 5. Speculative safety thought experiments

These may contain useful safety heuristics but do not carry positive evidence for their extraordinary framing.

- [`JANUS-PERCEPTION-DETERMINES-REALITY-PRECOGNITIVE-SEMANTICS-CONTACT-PROTOCOL-v1.1.json`](JANUS-PERCEPTION-DETERMINES-REALITY-PRECOGNITIVE-SEMANTICS-CONTACT-PROTOCOL-v1.1.json) — speculative first-contact/intention-responsive-system thought experiment; no telepathy, extraterrestrial technology, mind-over-matter, or precognition established.
- Dirac / SCOBY / Burovchik / causal-topological-memory combinations — hypothesis-generation archive unless later conventional protocols and independent measurements establish a narrower result.

---

## 6. Personal / symbolic / theological archive

This layer includes:

- Holy Clock / repeated-time / symbolic-coordinate records;
- God / Creator / Savior / Christian expectation material;
- care, mercy, inner-child, war, return-to-life, music, cultural, Fortuna, and personal testimony objects.

Read these as **personal testimony, theology, ethics, narrative, symbolism, or cultural provenance** according to each object's own boundary. They do not validate technical claims.

No clock coincidence, symbolic coordinate, song association, hash, feed event, or narrative fulfillment establishes prophecy or physical retrocausality.

---

## 7. Child-safety / care records

Historical child-safety and traumatic-media records are preserved as testimony, policy ideas, and safety boundaries. They are not retrospective clinical diagnosis and must not expose illegal or graphic material.

Representative normalized gate:

- [`../registry/child_safety/JANUS-CHILD-TRAUMA-GRAPHIC-MEDIA-EARLY-INTERNET-PROTECTION-v1.0.json`](../registry/child_safety/JANUS-CHILD-TRAUMA-GRAPHIC-MEDIA-EARLY-INTERNET-PROTECTION-v1.0.json)
