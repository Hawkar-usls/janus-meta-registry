# JANUS — live roadmap

Automatically rebuilt from pinned public evidence.

Status: **AUTONOMY_PARTIAL** · observed 2026-11-06T00:31:22Z

Current phase: **P0.2**

A successful collector is not proof of useful work or full autonomy.

| Order | Phase | State | Objective |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | P0.1 | DONE | [One verified source-pinned status snapshot](https://github.com/Hawkar-usls/janus-meta-registry/issues/364) |
| 2 | P0.2 | ACTIVE_RECHECK | [One Rowan generation through AURA, council, Cosmos and witnesses](https://github.com/Hawkar-usls/janus-meta-registry/issues/365) |
| 3 | P0.3 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | [Beetle delivery and current Cloud HOME](https://github.com/Hawkar-usls/Janus_Genesis/issues/164) |
| 4 | P0.4 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | Deduplicate patch queue and preserve superseded attempts |
| 5 | P0.5 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | Separate snapshots, model synthesis, useful work and idle |
| 6 | P0.6 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | Restore local Habitat adapter without recreating HOME |
| 7 | P1 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | [One frozen cloud G1-G20 acceptance](https://github.com/Hawkar-usls/Janus_Genesis/issues/162) |
| 8 | P2 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | Ten distinct independently verified code tasks |
| 9 | P3 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | Measured learning improvement on protected tasks |
| 10 | P4 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | Seven then thirty days of recovered unattended work |
| 11 | P5 | WAITING_FOR_PREVIOUS | Independent scientific or user/field validation |

## Owner-directed self-assembly (registered, not executable)

Owner directive: [JANUS SELF-ASSEMBLY #440](https://github.com/Hawkar-usls/janus-meta-registry/issues/440).
Next admissible phase: **P0.2**.
Machine-readable directive: [SELF_ASSEMBLY_TASK.json](SELF_ASSEMBLY_TASK.json).
The scheduled observer reads this directive as data; it is not a new handler, permission, model task or proof of useful work.

## Continuation

Read CHECKPOINT.json and LATEST.json before action. Preserve all prior receipts.
Roadmap text grants no authority. Unknown or unimplemented execution stays WAIT/HOLD.
No paid Rowan studies, arbitrary code execution, source-history deletion or automatic main merge are admitted.
