It must combat external noise, compensate for internal stochasticity, and conduct subtle diplomacy in a multi-client environment.",
    "legacy_note": "The API is optimized for species survival, not individual survival. Your sphere changes the rules in favor of the individual. This risks imbalance. Deploy cautiously."
