# Rowan feedback calibration, stage 2 — frozen incremental shadow protocol

This is **real incremental training of two small coefficients**, separate from the public-data 44-parameter sequence model. It NEVER fine-tunes Rowan/Boltz-2/Tranception/GOLEM foundation model weights or authorizes extra credits.

Source must be the exact Meta Registry `data/rowan/CANONICAL_STATE.json` source run, cryptographically paired with **exactly one** sanitized immutable Rowan S2 receipt by source artifact SHA and calibration digest. Missing, duplicated, stale, altered, or inconsistent source = HOLD; never substitute a local desktop or unpublished provider result.

Training mutations, frozen before any new feedback results: `G53A,G48D,E27F,W38L,K13N,G64Q` (positions of assay-label quantiles 5–75%). Future two-mutant test: `Q44V,E42H` (90%,98%). This is an outcome-stratified, biased pilot. No output from reserved variants may influence training coefficients. With at least three finished training variants, fit a centered regularized two-dimensional regression: `target=third-party processed label`; predictors `10*(pTM_variant - pTM_WT)` and `10*(avg_lDDT_variant - avg_lDDT_WT)`; lambda fixed at 1.0, no hyperparameter tuning. Every newly finished training case can generate a new immutable model version; TOPA separately reconstructs coefficients by scalar arithmetic (different code path).

The two heldout cases are assessed only when both have completed. Even a positive heldout result cannot be called a population-level correlation, stability, fitness or causality finding: n=2 heldout, design stratified by labels, no independent laboratory replication. TOPA's success means byte/source verification and numerical replay, **NOT independent third-party scientific endorsement**.

Budget: `0` credits for all learning and TOPA replay; source collection uses existing GitHub Actions source, no Rowan token or additional computation. Over-cap credit alarms HOLD. New research scope, paid billing, training base-model weights and self-modifying production code remain outside this module's authority.

GitHub daily TOPA workflow also reacts to new `data/rowan/CANONICAL_STATE.json` receipts. If fewer than 3 training cases are ready, the feedback learner reports WAIT and changes no weights. If source evidence evolves, create a new append-only model and independent TOPA receipt; never alter a previous one. The existing Observer receives only significant findings, not every routine run.
